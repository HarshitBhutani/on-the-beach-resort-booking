    <p class="primary">For many holiday makers, scouting out a quality coffee shop is high on the list of priorities as you settle into your accommodation. Because we understand the importance of a good morning coffee ritual, we have created a list of our top barista and brew picks within easy walking distance of On The Beach Noosa.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Early morning - Café Le Monde</h4>
    
    <p>Café Le Monde is a Noosa institution, renowned for its delicious Clandestino coffee, amazing food and great night vibes. If coffee is your passion, you can even check out the Clandestino roastery during your stay … it’s located within the mind-boggling, taste-tempting haven known as Belmondo's in Noosa’s Industrial estate. Café Le Monde opens at 6am and serves quality brews throughout the day.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>A take-away with a glorious view - the Sails Coffee Cart</h4>
    
    <p>Nestled in the picturesque nook in the National Park end of Main Beach, you will discover the tantalising scent of steaming hot coffee each morning. The Sails Coffee Cart is the perfect destination for a quick, tasty fix after a refreshing dip in the ocean.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Coffee with flair - Aromas</h4>
    <p>Aromas had been bringing the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Paris and Melbourne to Hastings Street for years. This popular café is so revered for its coffee that it has its own beans, blended by famed barista Tim Adams, sourced from sustainable farms in Brazil and Columbia and roasted right here on the Sunshine Coast. The result… a mouth-watering brew that will satisfy every enthusiast.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Mid-day pep up - Providore on Hastings</h4>
    <p>Providore on Hastings is an excellent destination for shoppers seeking a little pick-me-up while they peruse Hastings Street’s plentiful boutiques. Serving the much-celebrated Little Cove Coffee, this store also boasts a peaceful location if you are needing a little time out. The team’s passion for serving local fare means there is an excellent range of locally sourced treats to enjoy in or take out and relish later.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>A lavish (coffee) cocktail - Locale</h4>
    <p>If you are looking to add some spice to your evenings in Noosa, look no further than the ever-alluring Locale, where espresso martinis are crafted by uber-talented bar staff. Their take on the classic is exceptional, as is their cold drip coffee Negroni.</p>
