    <p class="primary">Few things say quintessential Queensland holiday more than time spent on or by the seaside, with salty breezes blowing and the warmth of the sunshine on your skin. In Noosa, water activities are a way of life and the many waterscapes are abuzz with surfers, boaters and fisherman year-round, thanks to the endless stretches of river, beach and estuary.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>Getting on the water in Noosa is both easy and safe for holiday makers, particularly with the array of boat hire businesses lining Noosaville’s Gympie Terrace. From party pontoons to tinnies, there are a range of options to get you off the shore and taking in the spectacular views from a different vantage point. Pack an esky, a BBQ picnic, a fishing line and a map of the river or plan to pull up at a park for some fresh, local fish and chips. Either way, prepare for a day of adventure that you will cherish forever.</p>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>Whether you opt for a half or full day hire, all of the boat companies will set you off with some easy instructions, tips on the day’s conditions and ideas for making the most of the stunning scenery, wildlife and waters. You can even discover your own slice of secluded Noosa and pull up for a private picnic with your loved ones while the children play with soldier crabs on the shore.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>Remember your bathers and sun protection and ask the team at On The Beach Noosa to assist with your booking. Boating is an extremely popular activity in Noosa, particularly during the school holiday periods.
