    <br>
    <p class="primary">Nestled behind Noosa’s glamourous Main Beach and Hastings Street, you will discover the serenity and beauty of the Noosa River – one of Australia’s most pristine tributaries, which meanders amongst some of the region’s most celebrated real estate.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>It goes without saying that the best way to explore this gem is aboard one of the many regular cruises frequenting the waters.</p>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>Noosa River and Canal Cruise is a local icon – offering relaxing daytime and sunset options that incorporate healthy doses of exceptional knowledge, interesting side notes and boundless beauty. With open air and undercover seating options, this cruise is enjoyable for all and can be complemented by self-catered meals and snacks or an array of delicious treats available for purchase on board.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>If you prefer a more upbeat energy, the M.V. Catalina is the cruising option for you. As “Noosa’s only premium floating event space”, this glamourous vessel takes inspiration from the French Riviera and transports those pleasure-seeking party goers up and down the Noosa River three nights a week and on special occasions.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>Tickets for the Friday Night Social, Saturday’s Lunch on the Water and Saltwater Sundays event are available online. Each event runs for about three hours, is soundtracked by seriously talented DJs or acoustic artists, offers delectable delights from Noosa’s best caterers and serves up icy cold ales and crisp cocktails.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>At the end of your cruise, you will leave with salt-tousled locks, a super satisfied palate and a smile from ear to ear.
