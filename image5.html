    <br>
    <p class="primary">There is no doubt that when it comes to the uber-popular sport of stand-up paddleboarding, there is no better place to enjoy it than Noosa.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>For novices, intermediates and (self-proclaimed) experts, the beauty of Noosa’s waterways is a playground suited to every level of experience.</p>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>Noosa River’s serene canals are perfect for beginners and are home to a number of SUP hire companies providing lessons and tours, so this is the place if you are looking to break the seal!</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>The main river boasts endless sandbanks (a great place to take a break and enjoy the scenery) and the “Frying Pan” on the north side of the river mouth, is an ideal location for spotting local birds and marine life. The popularity of this river amongst boaters makes it a better bet if you have a little experience, as it can be bumpy at times.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>For the SUP aficionado, Laguna Bay offers the perfect combination of challenge and reward. A paddle around First Point toward Tea Tree and Granite Bays on a calm day gives unbelievable vantage to the Noosa Heads and viewing of dolphins, stingrays and turtles. If you are a capable paddleboarder, this truly is an experience not to be missed. Just be sure to keep the wind direction, waves, swell and weather forecasts in mind for added security.


    </p><br>
    <p>Private and group lessons, as well as SUP tours and straight board hire, are available with the knowledgeable and friendly team from Noosa Stand Up Paddle. You can find them on Gympie Terrace in Noosaville and they will drop you back at your On The Beach Noosa accommodation at the end of the fun!

    </p><br>
    <p>Discovering Noosa by SUP is a truly memorable way to add to your On The Beach Noosa stay and a great way to burn off some extra calories while on holidays!</p>
