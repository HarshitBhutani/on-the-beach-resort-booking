                Lovely stay at On The Beach. We had one of the penthouse apartments and it was perfect. Fantastic view, spacious, modern, clean, great friendly staff. Would highly recommend next time in Noosa! But I would stay longer -

                In my opinion probably one of the best located properties on Hastings street and the front desk reception staff are very helpful and provided a great service. We received confirmation phone calls prior to check in and the room was ready before we arrived.
                Overall very pleased with the cleanliness and all round service. -

                Spa & BBq just made it so much nicer, We intend going back there in the near future. Room Tip: All top floor rooms have great views directly over the beach front. -
