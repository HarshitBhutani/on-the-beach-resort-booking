    <br>
    <p class="primary">Noosa is superbly situated for holidaymakers wishing to be humbled by the presence of the ocean’s most majestic residents.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>Between June and November, visitors can spot the frolicking Humpback Whales from the headlands, as they make their way to the warmth and safety of their Hervey Bay breeding grounds, or return south to the Antarctic waters with their newest family members</p>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>During peak season, swimmers and beachgoers may even be fortunate enough to spot a humpback or two from glorious Main Beach!</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>If you’re not having much luck with your on-land whale spotting, an off-shore whale watching cruise is sure to satisfy. Offering guaranteed sightings, the knowledgeable Whale One team depart from Mooloolaba (45 mins south of Noosa) daily on a large and luxurious catamaran that will take you to the centre of the action!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>It’s highly likely you will find yourself close enough to count barnacles as the whales dance and frolic in the azure waters, breach nearby or curiously circle the catamaran.

    </p><br>
    <p>For an undeniably unforgettable adventure, talk to the Whale One team about their incredible swimming with whales tours for those aged eight and over. Your family will cherish these magical holiday memories forever.
